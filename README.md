# Intro

Hello! I'm @810hd on twitter and this is the place where I will be documenting all of my box writeups as I study for the OSCP exam. 

Right now I'm still somewhat new to OSCP studying \(began in April\) and there are not many writeups at the moment. I will also link [my github page](https://github.com/810hd) for future references \(code, tool & cheatsheet repos\).

The writeups subtitled with \(wlk\) are boxes that take you through the process \(with varying hints\) and do not just simply ask for the user/root.txt, flags etc. The subtitle \(L\) indicates a Linux box while \(W\) indicates Windows.

I'm always open for discussion, collaboration or whatever. Feel free to hmu on twitter.
